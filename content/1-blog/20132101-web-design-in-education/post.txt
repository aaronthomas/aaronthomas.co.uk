Alternative title: _Concerns about formal education in web design and how we might tackle them._

We all know that the value and quality of formal education in web design is a somewhat touchy subject within our industry, and having graduated from New Media at the University of Leeds just last year I found myself particularly opinionated on the matter.

Theres a lot that can be said about the issue and I’m not going to discuss everything here, but I want to take a moment to reflect on my own academic approach, and try and tackle some of the issues we have with it.

## In my experience

First and foremost, I want to say this: _New Media is not a bad course_. I just found myself somewhat unsatisfied by the time it was all over – it simply wasn’t for me. I knew from the start that I didn’t need a degree to work in the web, but I felt it was an experience I couldn’t have done without. I don’t doubt for a second however, that I’d be a much better developer if I spent my 3 years self-teaching myself coding best practices and design principles rather than sat in a dreary lecture theatre.

There was a lot of stuff I learnt which was, if nothing else, interesting. The content of the degree was somewhat varied, In a single day I could find myself learning about how a telegraph works, then sit a lecture on how dendograms can be used for data analysis, followed by a workshop on flash animation (which I believe they still continue to teach). Now I don’t know about you, but I’m not sure how I’m meant to apply the technical workings of a telegraph to modern web design, and I’m somewhat concerned that it’s compulsory study in a course called New Media.

So it was a broad course. A course which has seen it’s graduates land themselves in a wide range of careers, from techie developer types like myself, to PR Executives and Marketing Managers. It’s was a great opportunity for those who didn’t really know exactly where they wanted to do end up, just that they wanted to do something on the web. Unfortunately though, that wasn’t me. I knew exactly where I wanted to be in 3 years time. I found there was very little material taught that was relevant to my own aims and objectives, so I ended up spending many late nights learning the things I really wanted to learn about in my own time.

On the flipside, the material that was relevant to me was generally very good. First year module Interface Design helped me to understand the importance of accessibility in web design, whilst a second year module introducing PHP and MySQL set me up nicely to dabble in backend programming and WordPress. Project modules that gave me free reign over what I produced were also great fun and gave me a great opportunity to supplement my studies with what I’d been learning in my own time. There was even an odd workshop on WordPress and jQuery, though they were simply a case of “this is how you install it, and this is how you search Google for plugins/themes”.

## So what’s the problem?

The major concerns people have with formal education of web design can be summarised in the following two points:

- Formal education is too slow to keep up with the fast pace of the modern web.
- Working well on the web is something best learnt through practical exposure and experience, not academia.

The biggest issue is that most web courses teach drastically out-of-date material. I learned that first hand, sitting modules of Flash animation and being encouraged to use Dreamweaver to code. Methods and best practices in the web change really fast, we already know that – take a moment think about how long it’s been since we were building fixed-width rather than responsive, using Flash over HTML5 canvas, and using “web safe” fonts rather than live web fonts. Not long ago at all is it? The academic nature of formal education programmes mean they struggle to adapt and evolve fast to deliver relevant and up-to-date material fo working in todays web.

The second point is not one of quality, but of value. It’s very rare to come across a job post for a career in the web that requires a degree. And rightly so – everything that you need to know about web design, code and methodology can be learnt through self teaching. The web industry is a fantastic community that is brilliant in it’s willingness to share. There’s an endless number of blogs, tutorial sites and online resources for learning that are free and open to us all, so why waste time sitting in a classroom when you can get your education from the comfort of your own sofa? Sure, you might not get a piece of paper at the end of it, but do we really need that? With more and more services such as Treehouse and Codeacademy surfacing which offer high quality learning, we have to question why on earth we would spend so much on formal education.

I’m not trying to generalise here and say that all web courses are garbage because I’m sure that’s not the case, but it’s no big secret that good quality courses are few and far between.

## What can we do about it?

Given the amount of discussion and complaint about the quality of web design education in our industry, theres surprisingly little talk about what we can actually do to fix things, which is a awful shame, because theres a hell of a lot we can do.

After I graduated, I was lucky enough to get a job with Mixd who have strong connections with both Leeds University and York College and actively support them in pushing modern best practices. Last year, myself and [Matt](http://twitter.com/mattberridge) taught an optional workshop on responsive web design at Leeds Uni – which went well, though we were disappointed that the workshop wasn’t a compulsory part of the programme as I believe it should be. Following feedback from ourselves and students at Leeds, the programme has now been amended and I’ll be going back over in March to speak more about responsive design – but this time it’s compulsory. In addition to that, I’ll be back at Leeds this month talking about Getting a Job in New Media, and next month about the Mixd workflow and how we approach our projects.

I urge you all to get in touch with your local web courses, and offer your help. It doesn’t have to be something like teaching or talking if that’s not your thing, but at least try to advise them on what’s important in modern web design so that it might impact their programmes, because it’s only with these connections with the people that work on the front line of the industry will universities be able to catch up with today’s web.
