It's been a little over a year since I last wrote in this blog. The last post was in January 2014, when I wrote a lengthy review of 2013 and promised myself that I would keep it updated at least once a month.

I deleted that post.

This year I won't be making any empty promises to write regularly – not because I don't intend to, but simply because I don't want to feel the guilt when I don't find the timen or when can't think of a topic worth writing about. I even intended to write this very post on the 1st of January, and here I am a week later only just finding time - clearly it's in my nature to procrastinate, and this year I'm going to embrace that fact with open arms.

It's not that I'm a particularly busy person, because I'm not. I generally have at least a couple of free hours a day and most weeks I'll spend at least a full day doing almost nothing of note. My problem is motivation. I—like most others—work around 42 hours a week, 9 to 5 each day. during those hours I work hard and I get stuff done without any lack of motivation or inclination to procrastinate, most days I'll not even take a break because I'm too involved with my work and don't want to break a clean run.
